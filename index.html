<h1>Philosophy</h1>

<p>As RhythmVision embarked upon one of our first extensive programs, we knew it would be a challenge. Our mission was to provide a quality summer camp experience for a population of elementary school-aged children who faced a <br>variety of difficult situations. Since RhythmVision’s inception, we specifically chose challenged and underserved people as our target population. Key members of our organization have a history working with at-risk youth in educational and therapeutic environments.</p>

<h1>Data</h1>


<p>While there is theoretical and experiential evidence in the literature supporting the efficacy of group-based music and rhythm teaching strategies with children, very little empirical study has been conducted on direct benefits of drumming specifically on school belonging and self-perceptions of drumming competence. RhythmVision’s current evaluation study examines children’s perceptions of school belonging and will ultimately explore associations of drumming participation with other measures of school achievement and attendance. Thus, our evaluation of this work may provide a substantive contribution to the research literature in this area.<a href="#data-extra-text"><br>See more</a></p>
<div id="data-extra-text">
<p><u>Method:</u> To measure child outcomes in the Fort Logan Rhythmic Foundations study, a modified version of the Psychological Sense of School Membership Scale (PSSM) is administered pre- and post-program.  Prior research indicated that the PSSM has adequate internal consistency for the original and modified versions ranging from .80 to .88 (Goodenow, 1993b; Murdock & Bolch, 2005). In his research, Hagborg (1998) reported that PSSM scores predict student benefits derived during small group experiential learning experiences (Hagborg, 1993). Additional items were developed to examine student outcomes related to classroom drumming perceptions, school competence and self-worth, and cooperative learning.  Pre- and post-test data collection was conducted onsite in the classrooms within the school. The survey was administered by reading each item aloud to the group and allowing children to mark their responses. Program staff were present to address questions as they went along and extra support was provided to children whose first language was not English. Data were entered into databases specifically designed for the study, checked for accuracy, and analyzed.  Analysis included paired t-tests to examine change over time for program participants. Daily classroom observational data were also gathered and provided a qualitative complement to the quantitative data. Interviews with key stakeholders are also an element of the RV’s qualitative evaluation.</p>

<p><u>2011-2012 Findings:</u> The school belonging outcome showed that children’s scores statistically significantly improved between the pre and post test. The school competency construct also showed a statistically significant improvement from pre to post. Observational data indicated that the key skills of belonging, mastery, independence, and generous develop simultaneously in children over the course of the program and that key events experienced by children trigger more in-depth internalization of these concepts.  Interview data revealed that program strengths include powerful opportunities for building children’s leadership ability and the emerging connection with other areas of academic growth in the typical school day – the program helps form children’s foundation for learning. The program’s accessibility to children of all academic levels and demographic risks is another key strength. Program challenges include operating within the sometime-difficult-to-navigate school system and constraints such as the length of the school day.</p> 

<p><u>Quality Improvement:</u> RhythmVision values a continuous, quality improvement approach. Key evaluation findings are used in program decision-making by the executive director, the program teacher-facilitators, and the Board of Directors to shape, develop, and redirect program activities. The positive findings of the program implementation, and its evaluation to-date, have spurred strategic programmatic decisions.. For example, positive results encouraged Fort Logan to invite the program back for a second and third year of programming, supported the addition of new programmatic components to meet children’s needs at Fort Logan Elementary, and sparked the search for additional funding. The program also uses process/program implementation data such as children’s attendance to monitor the dosage of the program children receive: a) to address when children’s attendance wanes and b) to help explain quantitative findings. The program is currently in the process of creating a more systematic and timely approach to using program data to make mid-course corrections to program activities and to respond to the needs of the school and program participants. One recent addition to the program’s system of continuous improvement is the use of children’s self-and-peer evaluations to provide ongoing opportunities for discussion and growth among the teacher-facilitators and the children. As the program components demonstrate sustained effectiveness and develop a stable evidence base, we will be able to develop a system for replication and for monitoring fidelity to the program model that will help us provide consistent and quality programming.<p> 

<p><u>Evaluation growth:</u> In terms of evaluation next steps, the program intends to boost the rigor of the findings by formally incorporating the non-program comparison group. Our piloting of this design element informed us that we need to collect pre and post comparison data for the study, rather than post-only because of initial (pre-program) differences between the children who got the program versus those who did not. In this way we will be able to control for initial differences for a more accurate group comparison.  Other areas for improvement and growth in our evaluation include the following: a) creation of a parallel version of our survey in Spanish to accommodate data collection in the language children are most comfortable with; b) addition of a stronger implementation and fidelity monitoring component to ensure high quality programming and to use in ongoing decision-making; c) collection of formal school data on outcomes, such as reading and math scores, to assess the program’s contribution to potential improvements other academic domains; d) addition of creative data collection techniques with technology and recording equipment as a source of analyzable qualitative data; e) inclusion of several child-level case studies that may include examinations of parental involvement, more in-depth child, teacher, and parent interviews, and examination of school data; and f) creation of a staff-accessible database and tracking system to document attendance, daily observations, and ongoing assessment findings for ongoing storage and monitoring of program data.</p>



<p><u>Teacher Assessment Report:</u>

Upon completion of full courses, RhythmVision instructors can provide written assessments that give an overview of classes and individual performances.  These detailed reports serve as way to communicate levels of student involvement and goals reached.</p>   

<p><u>Student Knowledge Tests:</u>

These tests are administered at the onset of an extended length program and at the end.  In the case of our Rhythmic Foundations class, we teach and assess skills related to basic music skills. We assess skills in reading fluency as part of Digital Reader's Theatre.  Both knowledge tests contain questions that gauge basic awareness of the Wheel of Courage's 4 principles.</p>
